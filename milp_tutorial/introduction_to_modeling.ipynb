        "Are you looking to learn the basics of mathematical optimization modeling? If so, then this is a great place to start. In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the process of building a mathematical optimization model and solving a mathematical optimization problem. We’ll begin by giving you an overview of the key components of a simple mathematical optimization problem, then show you how to create a mathematical optimization model (or, to be more precise, a mixed-integer programming or MIP model) of the problem using using the Gurobi Python API, and then demonstrate how you can automatically generate an optimal solution using the Gurobi Optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "This modeling tutorial is at the introductory level, where we assume that you know Python and that you have a background on a discipline that uses quantitative methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may find it helpful to refer to the [documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/?category-filter=documentation)\n",
        "of the Gurobi Python API. This notebook is explained in detail in our series of tutorial videos on mixed-integer linear programming. You can watch these videos by clicking\n",

        "## Problem description\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a consulting company that has three open positions: Tester, Java Developer, and Architect. The three top candidates (resources) for the positions are: Carlos, Joe, and Monika. The consulting company administered competency tests to each candidate in order to assess their ability to perform each of the jobs. The results of these tests are called *matching scores*. Assume that only one candidate can be assigned to a job, and at most one job can be assigned to a candidate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is to determine an assignment of resources and jobs such that each job is fulfilled, each resource is assigned to at most one job, and the total matching scores of the assignments is maximized.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Mathematical optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematical optimization (which is also known as mathematical programming) is a declarative approach where the modeler formulates an  optimization problem that captures the key features of a complex decision problem. The Gurobi Optimizer solves the mathematical optimization problem using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science.\n",
        "\n",
        "A mathematical optimization model has five components:\n",

This means that there is not enough budget to allocate the three resources we have. Consequently, the Gurobi Optimizer must choose two resources to fill the jobs demand, leave one job unfilled, and maximize the total matching scores. Notice that the two top matching scores are 80% (Joe for the Tester job) and 73% (Monika for the Java Developer job). Also, notice that the lowest score is 13% (Carlos for the Architect job). Assigning Joe to the Tester job, Monika to the Java Developer job, and nobody to the Architect job costs $\\$5,000$  and yields a total matching score of 153. This is the optimal solution found by the Gurobi Optimizer."
